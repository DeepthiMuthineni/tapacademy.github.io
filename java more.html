    <h1>What is java</h1>
    <p>The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability. Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors in its appeal. 
        Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features. 
        In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use.<br><br> 
        Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, 
        which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike.<br><br>
        Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. 
        There are many useful classes and functions in Java's standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more capability.<br><br></p>

    <h1>Advantages of java</h1>
    <p>The use of Java as a programming language has a number of benefits. Some of the main benefits are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Java is a straightforward programming language since it is simple to learn and comprehend.</li>
    <li>Java uses implicit pointers, making it a secure programming language.</li> 
    <li>Java code does not need to be constantly compiled in order to execute on a variety of systems.</li>
    <li>Java has strong memory management, making it a robust programming language.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above are some of the advantages of using Java and building applications making it the most popular programming language after Python. </p>
<h1>Features of java</h1>
<p>A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Platform independence</li>
    <li>Object-oriented language</li>
    <li>Automatic memory management</li>
    <li>Multi-threading support</li>
    <li>High performance </li>
    <li>Scalability</li>
</ul>
    <p>Because they enable writing, testing, and deploying software applications simpler, quicker, and more effectively, Java’s characteristics are crucial for software development. 
    These capabilities enable developers to produce strong, safe, and high-performing programmes that satisfy the requirements of contemporary software development.</p>
